Issues :- 

1. Classification of families above/below poverty line .
2. Outgoing grains << Incoming grains 
3. Mixing of grains, Adulteration of grains, 
4. Whom can we trust in system .(Taking assumption that, shopkeepers are Rational).
5. Identification where are is the fault and all data available to general public. ( On Blockchain?).

If (Incoming + Adulteration == Outgoing) then how checking for Adulteration at each step .

'''
A govt certified machine in every PDS shop, like an electric meter, Keep the grains, inside it ? Or on it, that'd weight the grains, but how about large quantity and duplicacy ? 
That machine will check for quality .
'''

Right now shops are assigned to different people .
De-centralized PDS shops, (Rating + Review system) for each shop 

Understanding actual PDS --- 
Cost of (Computer+Person) > (Person) if this outweighs, the other cost. 
Many overheads cost will make price/kg will increase -> eq to cost of normally ~ 
In rural areas, literacy is low , so to keep digital checkpoints simple .

Keeping both quality and quantity labels and checks .

Irrerisible openable containers, (like LPG cylinders), Once opened/tampered with , then everyone knows, (package for every person? )

Have some random machines outside the shop ( diff for grains / oil / etc ) and every/any random person can test the food . Enter the food and id of shop .

Incentivising the middlemen .

Propose a system and defend it . Only report ? No. Include UML diagrams/ Flowcharts for better marks . Simple and succint.

Directly use FedEx / Postal system's / Amazon's thing , (just cite) or explain ?

Retika mam's paper recommendations ? Smart card for everybody ?
Suppose we rely on Aadhar, then acknowledge the assumptions. How much of it'll work ?
How much rely on Aadhar ? For acknowledgement about APL/BPL

Policy is important or technology important ?

What about feasibility of model ?
