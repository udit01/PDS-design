\Large \bf ABSTRACT
\end{center}
\vspace{0.2in}

I am going to design and present a model for a Public Distribution System for India. In this document, I'll talk about many vital and essential issues that have to be taken into account while designing a Digital Voting system for India. 
\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
The Model will satisfy many properties which make it a good model. Then I will argue thet why is it a very good model to be implemented.


% \vspace{0.5cm}

In this design project, I shall work as observer, developer and algorithm enthusiast to understand the ways and finding different means to approach and tackle the objectives in a more well defined mathematical way. 

\vspace{0.2cm}
% I shall work with full confidence and zeal to achieve the goal or reach to quite an end of the problem so that using our lemmas, proofs and knowledge, someday a perfect model can be implemented using a software by some other Computer Explorer. As a matter of interest, I just wish to argue that these things can be computed by our brain so I do hope to find a solution to this problem using machine learning algorithms. Since, Machine Learning algorithms are more or less based on Mathematical matrices, with the use of computer graphics, I expect to find a start with matrices that I have dealt with further in this report.

\chapter{Rough Ideas}
These are some rough ideas thought, meant to be put cleanly in the final draft, remove this section after.
Other Ideas are in Research papers.
\section{Raw Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
Issues :- 
\\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  Classification of families above/below poverty line . 
  \item 
  Outgoing grains << Incoming grains . 
  \item 
  Mixing of grains, Adulteration of grains. 
  \item 
  Whom can we trust in system .(Taking assumption that, shopkeepers are Rational ?). 
  \item 
  Identification where are is the fault and all data available to general public. ( On Blockchain?). 
  \item 
  Fingerprint like authentication doens't actually match .
  \item
  Network infractructure is not so good in these parts of India.

\end{enumerate}
\item
If (Incoming + Adulteration == Outgoing) then how checking for Adulteration at each step .

\item
A govt certified machine in every PDS shop, like an electric meter, Keep the grains, inside it ? Or on it, that'd weight the grains, but how about large quantity and duplicacy ? 
That machine will check for quality .

\item
Right now shops are assigned to different people .
De-centralized PDS shops, (Rating + Review system) for each shop 

\item
Understanding actual PDS --- 
Cost of (Computer+Person) > (Person) if this outweighs, the other cost. 
Many overheads cost will make price/kg will increase --- > eq to cost of normally ~ 
In rural areas, literacy is low , so to keep digital checkpoints simple .
Keeping both quality and quantity labels and checks .

\item
Irrerisible openable containers, (like LPG cylinders), Once opened/tampered with , then everyone knows, (package for every person? )

\item
Have some random machines outside the shop ( diff for grains / oil etc ) and every/any random person can test the food . Enter the food and id of shop .

\item
Incentivising the middlemen .

\item
Propose a system and defend it . Only report ? No. Include UML diagrams/ Flowcharts for clarity . Simple and succint.

\item
Directly use FedEx / Postal system's / Amazon's thing , (just cite) or explain ?

\item
Prof. Retika mam's paper recommendations ? Smart card for everybody ? Pros and Cons of that system.
Suppose we rely on Aadhar, then acknowledge the assumptions. How much of it'll work ?
How much rely on Aadhar ? For acknowledgement about APL/BPL

\item
Policy is important or technology important ?

\item
What about feasibility of model ?  

\end{itemize}


\chapter{Introduction}

The problem of a relaible Public Distribution is one that is not limited to India, but a very prominent problem for developing countries. Using the cutting edge technology I hope to present a solution to this problem which will save us plants, workforce and sheer administrative manpower by a once effective and efficient investment by the governing body.

% {Basic Rules}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The following objectives are aimed to be discussed in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Defining the problem.
  % Support you design decisions ? 
  \item
  Desirable properties 
  % 9 SAK + 1 sankalan + others.
  \item
  Technical and Political Aspects
  % Tradeoffs ? Making strong both  ?
  \item
  Helpful Systems / Learning from other countries .
  % What are some things models already implemented ?
  \item
  Model  
  % Correctness, Scaling, Implementation, Support for model 
  \item
  Correctness , scaling , feasibility and Implementation
  \item 
  Epilogue/Conclusion
  % Closing the holes, who can we trust ? who will provide/manufacture the harware ? How will it be tested ?
  % How does it help ? What all is improved ? Other applications of this model ?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Defining the problem}
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Why do we need a PDS ?}
\section{How do we Currently Distribute ?}
What are the shortfalls of current system, among other description
Who can we trust in the sytstem ?


\chapter{Desirable Properties}
\section{Introduction}
What should be some properties of an PDS ? And how should we decide them ?
\section{Properties}
Now let's formally list the ideally desirable properties of Distribution System.

\chapter{Technical and Political Aspects}
Can a model like this really be implemented ? Who has the power to do this ? Who will conduct this ?
Social aspects ? Proof of authenticity at every step ?
\section{Key Aspects}

\chapter{Useful Systems}
\section{System in Other Countries ?}
How do Japan, USA (developed/developing coutries) manage delieveries of food and alike products in case of natural disasters, like draughts, crop faliure etc ?
\\
Directly packaging the products in tamper proof boxes ? Like LPG cylinders ? 

\chapter{Model}
\section{Software Aspect}
\section{Hardware Aspect}
\section{Social Aspect}
How will people play a role ? How to incentivize/dis-incentivize them ?
\section{Correctness}
How many desirable properties does it satisfy ? How is it feasible for Implementation in the whole country ?
\section{Scalability}
\section{Implementational feasibility}


\chapter{Epilogue}
\section{What does it accomplish ?}
What changes does it bring in the Elections that weren't there previously ?
\section{Applications}
Where else can this system be applied ?
\section{Future Scope}


\chapter{Conclusion}
What are some key learnings throught this excercize ? The power of the system is in it's being fully open source,by the random checks and balances of the people so no middlemen / govt. employess can break it .
